Being a gym enthusiast, i thought of a way to arrange my workouts and that's how i came up with workoutplanner. It is just a simple app that enables one to arrange their workouts. If you are the type to workout each body part seperately through out the week, then you can go to custom workout option. This option will have all the body parts and each body part will have many exercises enough to give you a proper workout for that body part. So you could do Chest on Monday, Legs on Tuesday and so on. If instead you would like to shock the muscle as Arnold puts it, head over to randomize. Randomize option has all the exercises for each body part that custom option has. The difference you might ask? Randomize will randomly select two exercises from whatever body part/category you select. Say you select Chest, it will randomly choose two exercises for you to work out for chest. Now you can select all the categories/body parts and you will get two random exercises for each. A good way to have a full body workout. Good thing about it? You get to do different combinations so your muscles never know what's coming. Isn't that something? The app has a few features within it but the most important, making working out fun and go shock those muscles!!
